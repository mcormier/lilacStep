This simple program can be used to automatically 
open .webloc files in the default web browser 
in windows.

To compile type 'make'.  
GNUStep is required for compilation.

lilac is most useful when you set it
as the default application to open .webloc files.
This will allow you to double click on a .webloc
file and allow it to automatically open in the
default web browser.

To set this up do the following:

1. Find a .webloc file
2. Right click on the file and choose properties
3. Click the "Change" button next to "Opens with:"
4. Find your compiled version of lilac.
